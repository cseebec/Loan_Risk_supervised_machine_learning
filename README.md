# Loan_Risk_supervised_machine_learning
Use a logistic regression model and a random forests classifier to predict whether loans will be high risk or low risk
The code for this repository is all in python

# Reading in data
The data for this project was from LendingClub. 

The training data for the models is the entire year of 2019 and the testing data is the first quarter of 2020

Disclaimer: This is not the raw data from LendingClub both of these CSVs have been undersampled to give an even number of high risk and low risk loans to help the accuracy of the models 

Once the models were read in all the non numeric data was converted to numeric data so that it could be used in the regression models 

The code compares 2 models Logistic Regression Model vs Random Forest Classifier.

The code not only runs the models to see how accurate the models are, but also the code explains what the values of the results mean so the data is easily readable / interpretable.
